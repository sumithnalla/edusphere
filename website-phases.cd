Phase 4 Part 1: Essential Admin Operations (6 pages)
These are CRITICAL - without them, admin can't run the platform
Manage Batches
CRUD for batch courses (Rankers/Sandana/Lakshya)
Without this: Can't create/edit course offerings
Student Payments
View all payment records with filters
Without this: Can't track revenue or pending payments
All Students
View/search all enrolled students
Suspend/activate accounts
Without this: Can't manage student access
Daily Classes
Schedule today's live classes (Maths/Physics/Chemistry)
Without this: Students see empty "My Classes" section
Tests
Create new exams with basic details
Without this: Students have no tests to attempt
Add Questions
Bulk CSV upload for 160 questions per exam
Without this: Exams exist but have no questions

Phase 4 Part 2: Advanced Admin Features (5 pages)
These are NICE-TO-HAVE - platform works without them, just less convenient
Recorded Classes
Manage recordings library
Why Part 2: Students already have live classes; recordings are supplementary
View/Edit Questions
Edit individual questions after bulk upload
Why Part 2: Can fix errors by re-uploading CSV; editing UI is convenience
Test Results
Detailed analytics: scores by batch, export CSV
Why Part 2: Students see their own results; admin analytics are bonus insights
Doubts Classes
Schedule doubts sessions (Lakshya only)
Why Part 2: Only 1 of 3 batches needs this; not core to all students
Admin Settings
Change admin password, manage multiple admins
Why Part 2: Single admin can manage via Supabase  dashboard initially
Part 1 = "Can't operate without these"
Need batches to sell courses
Need to see payments to know who paid
Need to allot access to students (already done in Phase 1)
Need to schedule daily classes (core product)
Need to create tests and add questions (core product)
Part 2 = "Makes life easier but not blocking"
Recordings are backup content
Question editing can be done via re-upload
Analytics are insights, not operations
Doubts are premium feature for 1 batch
Settings can be managed via Supabase initially
